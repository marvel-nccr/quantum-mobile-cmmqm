# Quantum Mobile 

Modified version of [Quantum Mobile v18.04](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/releases/tag/18.04.0) for the course
[**Computational methods in molecular quantum mechanics**](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/computational-methods-in-molecular-quantum-mechanics-CH-452)
held at EPFL in Fall 2018.

## What is Quantum Mobile

*Quantum Mobile* is a Virtual Machine for computational materials science.

It comes with a collection of software packages for quantum
mechanical calculations, including

 * [Quantum ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/)
 * [Yambo](http://www.yambo-code.org/)
 * [fleur](http://www.flapw.de/)
 * [Siesta](https://launchpad.net/siesta)
 * [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org)
 * [Wannier90](http://www.wannier.org)

all of which are set up and ready to be used through the
[AiiDA](http://www.aiida.net) python framework for automated workflows and
provenance tracking.

You can run Quantum Mobile on your Windows, MacOS or Linux computer using the
[VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/) software.
You can also 
[install Quantum Mobile on virtual machines using cloud services](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/ansible-playbook-workhorse)
like Amazon Web Services or OpenStack.

## Download the VM

Please see [releases](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/releases)
for the latest VM image and installation instructions.

For issues encountered during installation of the VM, see the
[FAQ](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

## Build it from scratch

You would like to add/remove some components of the VM
and produce your own modified VM image?

This git repository contains all the vagrant and ansible scripts required to
set up the VM from scratch (note: [plan >1h](other_stuff/timings.txt) for
this).

### Prerequisites

- [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) >= 2.0.1
- [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- Host OS: Building VM tested only on Unix systems so far (MacOS, Ubuntu).
  Might work under Windows with a few modifications.

### Create Virtual Machine

```
git checkout git@github.com:marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile.git
cd quantum-mobile
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest  # optional, improves interface
vagrant up  # build vm from scratch (takes some tens of minutes)
```

Note: Due to a bug in the vbguest vagrant plugin, there are some additional steps #60

### Create image
```
# optional: reduce size of VM
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --extra-vars "clean=true"
./compact_hd.sh

./create_image.sh
```

### Useful commands

 * `vagrant provision --provision-with ansible`: re-run ansible scripts
 * `vagrant reload`: restart machine
 * `vagrant halt`: stop machine
 * `ANSIBLE_ARGS="-twannier90" vagrant provision --provision-with=ansible`: run ansible scripts for the `wannier90` tag
 * ```
   ./setup-ansible.sh             # inform ansible about ssh config
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml  # run ansible directly, add tags, ...
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml  --tags wannier90
   ```
 * ```ssh -F vagrant-ssh default```
 * ```scp -F vagrant-ssh default:/path/on/vm  my/path```
 * ```./reconnect_vagrant.sh  # reconnect vagrant to an old VM```

## Publishing customized VMs

If you would like to publish a customized version of Quantum Mobile, we recommend that you

 1. Fork this repository
 1. Give your VM a different name to avoid confusion
 1. Adapt `globalconfig.yml`, `EULA.txt` and `README.md` appropriately
 1. Pull the latest changes from time to time to keep things up to date

Last, but not least, [let us know](mailto:leopold.talirz@gmail.com)!
